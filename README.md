## Usage

You will need the **Twilight Princess ISO** -- currently only the US version is supported.

1. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/hallcristobal/tpgz/releases).

2. Unzip the contents into a folder and run the `romhack-patcher.exe`

3. Select the associated patch file and the Twilight Princess ISO

4. Click apply

    * You will be asked to select a save directory for the newly patched ISO. After giving the ISO a name, the patcher will freeze briefly while generating the ISO.

5. You can now load the generated ISO in Dolphin emulator or on Wii in a homebrew loader such as [Nintendont](https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont).
